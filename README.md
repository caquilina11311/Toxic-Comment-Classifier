# Toxic-Comment-Classifier

# Overview:
# Developed a machine learning pipeline for classifying toxic and abusive online comments using a dataset of 150K+ entries. Implemented a custom NLP preprocessing workflow with NLTK normalization (achieving 35% vocabulary reduction), TF-IDF vectorization, and regex-based text cleaning. Trained and optimized multiple models, including a 3-layer CNN with dropout, an SVM with RBF kernel (93% precision), and an SGD classifier with elastic net regularization. Combined models via ensemble learning to achieve 95% accuracy, 97% F1-score, and AUC = 0.96. Evaluated performance using k-fold cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
